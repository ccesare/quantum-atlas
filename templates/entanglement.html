          Of all the peculiar things that occur in the quantum world, none is more likely to sprain the brain than the phenomenon called entanglement. Einstein himself called it totally whacko. But over the past 50 years, physicists have accumulated a huge body of experimental evidence that entanglement is real. Weird but real.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          It works like this: As a result of <span class="blue selector" onclick="toggle('sidenote-1')">certain quantum processes,<span class="f6 pb2 relative" style="top:-.5rem;">⊕</span></span>
         <span class="sidenote side f7 sans-serif lh-copy gray fr pr6 pl5 mb3 mt3 pa0-l ma0-l mt1" id="sidenote-1"><span class="f6 pb2 blue relative" style="">⊕ </span> For example, a particle with 0 spin might decay into two entangled particles with -1/2 and +1/2 spin. Alternatively, when a laser beam travels through a certain kind of “nonlinear” crystal, it sometimes splits into pairs of entangled photons.</span>two or more objects (photons, electrons, atoms, etc.) become so inextricably intertwined—“entangled”—that even if they are physically separated, often by great distance, they have a shared existence and cannot be described independently.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          This leads to seemingly incredible outcomes: When you measure a property of one of a pair of entangled quantum objects (such as its momentum, polarization, or <a href="spin.html">spin</a>), and then measure the same property on the other object, the results are always, invariably correlated. It looks suspiciously like the measurement made on the first object instantaneously determines the properties of the second object.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          <em>Whoa.</em> That kind of behavior seems to be completely at odds with a bedrock quantum principle—namely, that a particle does not have specific properties until it is measured. Until then it exists in a <a href="superposition.html">superposition</a> of properties with different odds of occurring.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          That’s also true for entangled particles. Measuring a property of one of them will still result in a random value that was completely unknowable prior to the measurement. But the corresponding property of the other will always be exactly correlated. That’s because entangled particles are not separate, individual entities. They’re both parts of a single quantum system.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          Picture two entangled photons that fly away in opposite directions until they are on opposite sides of the galaxy. Each is in a superposition of “spin up” and “spin down.” They are prepared in such a way that if someone measures the spin of Photon 1 and finds that it is up, then the spin of Photon 2 is down. Or vice versa. Every time. This happens despite the fact that there is no possible way for information about the result of Photon 1’s measurement to reach Photon 2—<em>even if it traveled at the speed of light</em>.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          Einstein balked at that, dismissing entanglement as “spooky action at a distance.” He believed that there must be some localized but so far unknown “hidden variables,” existing prior to measurement, that could explain the inevitable correlations.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          In the 1960s, a test was devised to affirm entanglement and rule out the existence of hidden variables. The tests were ferociously difficult to perform, but after decades of increasingly sophisticated work, in 2015 an international team of physicists finally conducted an experiment in which the results could not be explained by any alternative interpretations, known as “loopholes.” That did not “prove” the existence of entanglement; “proof” is hard to come by in science. But it did serve to rule out other ways of interpreting the findings. So far.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          Another strange feature of entanglement is that two entangled particles (photons, say) that interact with two other kinds of particles (such as atoms) can entangle the atoms. That phenomenon is now being exploited in quantum information processing to transfer quantum states among various components of a system. It seems likely that any future quantum computer will harness the power of entanglement.
