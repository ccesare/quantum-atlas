It’s at work every time you strum a guitar and hear the tones from each string harmonize into a rich chord. You can see it in the ripples that dance on the surface of a pond after tossing in a handful of pebbles—the disturbances bump into each other and interfere on their journey toward the shore. Both cases capture a generic feature: Overlapping waves combine, blending their undulations by addition. The resulting wave shape is just a point-by-point sum of the individual waves.</p>
